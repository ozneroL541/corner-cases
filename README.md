# Corner Cases

> [!Warning]
> Do not use this code in real-world implementation.

## Library choice for Ed5519
We used [filippo.io/edwards25519](https://github.com/FiloSottile/edwards25519) for computing scalar multyplication and sum of points over the elliptic curve. The library contains the requested operations and is well mantained.  
Moreover, the mantainer seems to be competent and very expirienced in the topics.
